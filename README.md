So how do you make this work for you?

1. Edit the 'id' variable on line 7 to include your Steam ID
2. Upload all files to a web server capable of executing PHP code
3. Edit bg.psd as needed to customize to your liking, save as bg.png
4. Embed sig.php in your signature at https://www.seriousgmod.com/account/signature (center it too, it looks nice!)

SIDE NOTE: IF YOU EDIT THE CODE, BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THE THE DATA IS COMING FROM SERIOUSGMOD.COM SO TRY TO KEEP PAGE REQUESTS DOWN TO ONE PER EXECUTION, STORE ALL DATA IN THE USERDATA ARRAY IN THE GETDATA FUNCTION THEN REFERENCE THAT ARRAY ONLY, DO NOT CALL THE GETDATA FUNCTION MORE THAN ONCE.

Thanks and have fun!
